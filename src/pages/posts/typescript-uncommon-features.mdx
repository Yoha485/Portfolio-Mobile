# Uncommon TypeScript Features

For the last couple of months I've been working with TypeScript a lot. Many cool features came to my mind and now I see more ways to use them. Here I would like to share some interesting features of TypeScript that I find interesting but not really common. None of these features are super unique(some of them could be even found in docs)

## Enumeration

TypeScript allows you to create a union of types like so <CodeWrapper>type Coffee = Latte | Espresso | Americano</CodeWrapper>. And this even works with strings or numbers like <CodeWrapper>type Coffee = "latte" | "americano"</CodeWrapper> and <CodeWrapper>type CoffeeId = 1 | 2 | 3</CodeWrapper>

However this gets worse if you need to specify a big range of numbers. In this case if you don't want to check your range conditionaly, you may find it usefull to create an **IntRange** type:

<CodeWindow code={`type Enumerate<N extends number, Acc extends number[] = []> = Acc['length'] extends N
  ? Acc[number]
  : Enumerate<N, [...Acc, Acc['length']]>\n
type IntRange<F extends number, T extends number> 
    = Exclude<Enumerate<T>, Enumerate<F>>

const num: IntRange<20, 300> = 200 // It's Ok
const num: IntRange<20, 300> = 1000 // This will give you an error
`} lang="ts" theme="material-lighter" />

<Marginer margin="50px" />

## Partial, Required, and Pick

Those three types are actually from <Button><a href='https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html'>TypeScript Utility Types</a></Button>. But among many others I find them particularly usefull.

The **Partial** is a type wrapper that makes all fields optional. This way you can make something like:
